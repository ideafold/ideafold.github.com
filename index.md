### General Info:

I am currently a second year Master candidate of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, under supervision of Professor Wei Liu. I am a member of Human Machine Interaction Lab, affiliated to Automation School. My research interests mainly focused on Information Retrieval, Recommendation System and Natural Language Processing(NLP) related topics. Currently, I am working on a chat bot system of open domain.


### Education:

1. **09/2011 -- present.**                                                                 
  MSc in Human Machine Interaction, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

2. **09/2007 -- 07/2011.**                                                             
  B.S. in Information Security, Xidian University.


### Projects:

1. **09/2012 -- present. Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications**                            
  Out of interest, I have been under developping a open domain chat bot system, which is a system using text as input and is expected to be more than a combination of ALICE and Waston of DeepQA. Over the reseach of the pass half year, I mainly have two discovers: i. to better understand the human language for a machine, it needs a good equipment(something like brain) and large scale facts; ii. an excellent business model is a must. The business model is used to promote the knowledge accumulation, after all, machines do not have foot or nose and can not get acquainted with the world. A good business model should maintain a health ecosystem among the knowledge producer, rules developper and knowledge customers, just like Google, if you understand what I mean. The result of DeepQA can be took as a good example of understand equipment. As to parser, I currently prefer to Stanford kind parser.

2. **07/2012 -- 04/2013. Alibaba Group**                             
  Over the period, as a Searching R&D Engineer of the Recommendation team, I saw that the system we developed experienced a rapid growth with pv increasing from 300w to serveral thousand millions, standing out as the largest web page recommendation system of China. What I did was to dig hot searching queries and to compute web page recommendations. I, as a core developer, had took part in the development of the web page recommendation system, which needs to process several Tbs training data and update the recomomendation model.

3. **12/2011 -- 07/2012. Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications**                         
   First, an assignment of the course Computer Vision was needed to completed. In this assignment, we were asked to recognize the fell athletes in a football match video. My solution was Surf + Bag of Words + 3 classifiers, which at last stood out with precision 0.78.
  After that, I went go studying image recognition system and image retrieval system, mainly paying close attention to the Exemplar Model，the description of shape and other descriptors, such as SIFT. But what impressed me most was those two projects of [Sketch2Photo](http://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/montage/main.htm)和[MindFinder](http://wwwconference.org/proceedings/www2010/www/p1309.pdf). The idea of those work is like that: first, user draw the shape of the object or scenery on a canvas; then the ready canvas was inputted to the image processing system. Finally, the image processing system will return user a set of images which tally with the canvas description. What on earth make their result so excellent? In my opinion, it's that their solution had implicitly utilized the bottom up && top down mechanism the way our brains work. This idea had made significant effect to my research, especially the development of the chat bot system.

4. **09/2009 -- 05/2011. Xidian University**                                                             
  In this period, my main effort was put on studying the route algorithms of wireless sensor, which was a project of National Undergraduate Innovative Experiment Program. Actually, playing around graph was all the stuff. At least, our team ranked the 10th of 100 teams.

5. **06/2008 -- 07/2009. Xidian University**                                       
  Established the [Xidian Linux Club](http://linux.xidian.edu.cn/bbs/forum.php) which has been supported by IBM since 2009. Over the period of those time, I acted as the chairman of this club. Besides, I was a member of the NewStar project which was led by our team supervisor Dr Hang Li. In this project, my main responsibility was to customize and optimize a linux system something like the [Linux From Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/) and to study the [Virtual Synchrony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_synchrony)。
